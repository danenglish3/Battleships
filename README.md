This program is to be used on Windows 10, and run with NetBeans IDE 8.2.

All inputs (other than username) uses capital letters, it is recommended to use caps lock through run-time.

This program is based off the popular board game, BattleShips. All the regular rules apply. The computer grid is completely
randomly generated at the beginning of each round, as well as the computers 'guesses' throughout the game. Until it gets one
right, it will then make an educated guess on its surrounding tiles.

If you want to see a visual representation of the computers grid on start-up, access Play.java and remove
the comments at line 68 - //Computer.computerGrid.drawGrid();
